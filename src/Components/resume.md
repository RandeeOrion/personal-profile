* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/GonzoDiamondElephants/git-sirius)
* Worked with a small team of three to build this single page React App that uses an extended  GitSchooled backend hosted on Heroku. We used Auth0 for authentication, Pusher npm package for the chat feature and rewrote out GitSorted project in React while utilizing our adorable JSON object apis from our previous project.

[GitSorted](https://git-sorted.herokuapp.com/) - Get yourself sorted into a Hogwarts House! 
* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/GonzoDiamondElephants/gitSorted)
* Worked with team of four after only 8 weeks of coding experience to build this app using EJS, CSS and JS
